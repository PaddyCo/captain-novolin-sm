# Captain Novolin for Super Metroid

Finally, two of the greatest games of all time in one package!

## How to use

This spritesheet is made with [SpriteSomething](https://github.com/Artheau/SpriteSomething) in mind.

Using SpriteSomething you can inject this sprite in pretty much any Super Metroid rom (Even SMZ3 roms!)

### TL;DR
Use [SpriteSomething](https://github.com/Artheau/SpriteSomething) to inject the `captain-novolin.png` sprite sheet into the Super Metroid rom of your choosing

### Longer version
